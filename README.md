# MONEY
 My first game, MONEY.
 
 # WHY ?
 Because here, we love money and potato games. This game can run on any computer, I know it is well optimised.

# HOW TO PLAY ?
This is very easy, you gonna see.
If you are not French, let me translate to you the game :

- "Voici les valeurs et leur intervalle respectifs" ==> "Here are the levels and their respective range"
- "Définissez le niveau dans lequel vous voulez jouer" "Set the level you want to play in"
- "Vous avez choisis le niveau X" ==> "You have chosen the level x"
- "La somme est entre X€ et X€" ==> "The sum is between X€ and X€"
- "Entrer une somme" ==> "Enter a sum"
- "Plus cher" ==> "More expensive"
- "Moins cher" ==> "Less expensive"
- "Bravo vous avez gagné ! La somme était bien X" ==> "Well done you win ! The sum was good X
- "Souhaitez vous rejouer ? ( oui / non )" ==> "Would you like to play again? ( Yes No )"

Hopefully you will learn a litttle bit of french with my game !
Merci de votre lecture !
